Thanks https://github.com/micmania1/html5pong

My version is a lot more lame.  I have taken something sweet and made it worse by combining it all into a single HTML file. Why?  Because I'm lazy and only want to pass around a single HTML file.

Also, I made it only single player.  Like I said, I made it worse.
